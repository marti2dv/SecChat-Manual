    <h2>Introduction to SecChat</h2>
    <p>
      SecChat is an secure chat program that allows you to communicate securely.
      Once connected, simply contact the user you would like to communicate with by their SecChat
      user name. Our network encrypts all messages so that no one can eavesdrop on your
      communication, and uses indirect message routing so that no one can tell which users are
      communicating.
