    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a sample interface of SecChat. The chat interface is not much different
      than you would expect from a chat program.
    </p>
    <img id="ui" src="images/ui.png">
    <p>
      The top left corner contains a textbox in which users can type enter a userid of someone 
      they know. This will send a request to the targer user to ask if they would like to communicate 
      with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tab underneath the connect dialog contains a chatroom containing information about
      the users in the chat, along with a screen for displaying messages. Users can have 
      multiple tabs open, thus chatting with multiple groups of people at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Users' list contains the userids of everyone in the current chatroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Messags' list displays the current conversation, much like you would expect from a typical
      chat program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the bottom of the interface contains a textbox that the user can type into to send
      messages into the current chat room. The disconnect button disconnects the user from the
      chatroom that is currently open.
