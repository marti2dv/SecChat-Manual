    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><b>Why should I use SecChat over other chat options?</b></p>
    <p class="answer">
      SecChat is a peer-to-peer network, meaning no one owns the server
      that your chat is hosted on. The chat records stay only on the computers
      in a given chat room. This makes SecChat good for people who are worried
      about security.
    </p>
    <p><b>What makes SecChat secure?</b></p>
    <p class="answer">
      SecChat uses encryption to hide what you are sending from eavesdroppers.
      SecChat also uses specialized routing to hide who various users are communicating
      with.
    </p>
    <p><b>What encryption does SecChat use?</b></p>
    <p class="answer">
      SecChat currently uses RSA public key cryptography. Wikipedia has a good explanation of RSA
      encryption that can be seen
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">here</a>
      if interested.
    </p>
    <p><b>How are messages sent through the SecChat network?</b></p>
    <p class="answer">
      SecChat uses our own custom built network based on Kademlia, which is
      a peer-to-peer system for distributed storage. The academic paper
      describing Kademlia can found
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">here.</a>
